Don't use Chai for tests, use Jest instead.

# Asserts

Use `expect.objectContaining` where possible to validate structured outputs in their entirety, instead of drilling down to individual properties to validate them one by one.

# Test programs

Don't hardcode line numbers for test programs, it's brittle and requires renumbering if test program is edited. Instead, use comments in debuggee code and `TestUtils.getLineNumbersFromComments` in test code. Use `TestUtils.getTestSource` to generate expected DAP `source` values.
